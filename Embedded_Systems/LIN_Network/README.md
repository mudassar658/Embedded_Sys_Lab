Local Interconnect Network (LIN)-based Arduino Network

Scope
The system scope is to develop a LIN based network using two Arduino hardware components along with few sub components such as sensor and led display which should have the capability to transfer sensor data from one Arduino to another Arduino in the network and display the output to a connected display.

Requirements
The requirement of the system is to design, implement and present an embedded system networked between two Arduinos to implement Local Interconnect Network (LIN) functionality and transfer data from master device to slave device.
